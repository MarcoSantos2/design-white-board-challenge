# UX Whiteboard Challenge - Development TODO

## Make sure to follow a mobile first approach. Make sure to always use Roboto font for all text.

## üîß Global Development Guidelines
- Always consult tokens under `frontend/figma/tokens` before creating or editing any UI component.
  - Map colors, spacing, radius, typography, and shadows to existing tokens.
  - Prefer CSS custom properties (exported variables) over hardcoded values.
  - If a needed value is missing, add a token first (do not hardcode).
  - Keep light/dark parity: verify both themes with the same token set.
